            <p>
                Designed to be a supplement to Coding it Forwardâ€™s <a href="/fellowship">Civic Digital Fellowship</a>, the Pipeline Program helps students, especially underclassmen, make real-world impact and learn what it's like to be a technologist in the public sector.

            <h2>Summer 2017</h2>

            <p>
                This summer, we're proud to be working with <strong>IRS, EPA, VA, and NIST</strong> to connect students with unpaid internship opportunities. Out of hundreds of applicants, we worked with leaders in these agencies to interview and hire a handful of students for each agency.
            </p>

            <h2>Work with us</h2>

            <p>
                If you're interested in interning in the public sector through the Pipeline Program or the <a href="/fellowship">Civic Digital Fellowship</a>, we encourage you to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/codingitforward">join our Facebook group</a> to get notified when we're starting applications for Summer 2018, and to connect with students, college clubs, startups, and other employers!
