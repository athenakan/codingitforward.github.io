                    The Civic Digital Fellowship is the product of a collaboration between <a href="http://codingitforward.com">Coding it Forward</a>, the <a href="http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io">Harvard Open Data Project</a>, former US Deputy CTO and Harvard professor Nick Sinai, and federal agencies such as the <strong>United States Census Bureau</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coding it Forward is dedicated to inspiring and empowering people to use their technology skills for social good. We are excited to be teaming up with these agencies to launch an elite public-sector summer fellowship program for college students interested in data science, technology, and data journalism.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>A cohort of eight student fellows will spend ten weeks in Washington, D.C. this summer</strong> to help them better serve American citizens. We will provide each fellow a <strong>dedicated mentor</strong> inside the agency they are assigned to. We expect that mentors will propose projects and that fellows will be matched with mentors and projects that match their interests and skills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This fellowship is targeted to students with both technical and non-technical skills. We are looking for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data scientists/software engineers</li>
                    <li>Product managers</li>
                    <li>Designers</li>
                    <li>Data journalists</li>
                </ul>
