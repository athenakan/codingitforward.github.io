            <p>
                The Civic Digital Fellowship is the product of a collaboration between <a href="http://codingitforward.com">Coding it Forward</a>, the <a href="http://harvard-open-data-project.github.io">Harvard Open Data Project</a>, former US Deputy CTO and Harvard professor Nick Sinai, and federal agencies including the Census Bureau and potentially the IRS and VA.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coding it Forward is dedicated to inspiring and empowering people to use their technology skills for social good. We are excited to be teaming up with these agencies to launch an elite public-sector summer fellowship program for college students interested in data science, technology, and data journalism.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>A cohort of student fellows will spend 10 weeks in Washington, D.C. this summer working with federal agencies</strong> to help them better serve American citizens. We will provide each fellow a <strong>dedicated mentor</strong> inside the agency they are assigned to. We expect that mentors will propose projects and that fellows will be matched with mentors and projects that match their interests and skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                This fellowship is targeted to students with both technical and non-technical skills. We are looking for:
