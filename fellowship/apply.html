        <li>Visit the Washington Center’s application portal and start an application.</li>
        <li>After registering as a new user, log in, and click "Internship" under the "Start a New Application" panel on the left.</li>
        <li>Under the question "Please select the option for which you wish to be considered", select the “Federal Diversity Internship Initiative.” Wait until the option to select year shows up, then select "2017." Wait until the option to select term shows up, then select "Summer Quarter".</li>
        <li>In the “How did you hear about this” section, choose “Other” and write “Civic Digital Fellowship.” We will not consider your application unless you type exactly “Civic Digital Fellowship” (without the quotes.)</li>
        <li>At the bottom of the “application options” page, choose the checkboxes for “U.S. Census Bureau.”</li>
        <li>The “Proof of Citizenship Document” is optional. (Remember, though, that you must be a US citizen to apply.)</li>
        <li>For your resume and statement of professional interest, be sure to hit “Upload”!</li>
        <li>In your statement of professional interest, don’t follow the instructions on the application. Instead, please just answer the following questions:
            <ol>
                <li>Describe an exciting software project you’ve built, a product you’ve shipped, or something you’ve written. Include any relevant links! (3-4 sentences)</li>
                <li>What are some unique, relevant skills and experiences, technical or otherwise, that you would bring to this internship? (2-3 sentences)</li>
                <li>You do not need to mail in an official transcript (although you can if you like.) Instead, upload your unofficial transcript to this Dropbox folder.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Which of the positions do you fit best, and why? Again, the positions are data scientist/software engineer, product manager, designer, and data journalist. Refer to the position descriptions for more information. (1-2 sentences)</li>
        <li>You do not need to submit letters of recommendation.</li>
        <li>Sign up for the mailing list, if you haven’t already, because that’ll be how we get in touch with you about next steps.</li>
</ol>
